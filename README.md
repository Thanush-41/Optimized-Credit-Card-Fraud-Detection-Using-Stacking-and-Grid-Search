# Optimized Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Stacking and Grid Search Techniques

##  Overview

This project presents a robust machine learning solution for **credit card fraud detection** using a hybrid model that combines **stacking ensemble learning** and **grid search optimization**. The proposed **GridStack** architecture significantly enhances fraud detection performance by integrating multiple base models and fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve **98% accuracy**.

##  Highlights

- Ensemble-based hybrid model with **stacking**
- Parameter tuning using **grid search**
- Achieved **98% accuracy**, **96% precision**, **96% recall**, and **96% F1-score**
- Compared against models like Random Forest, Isolation Forest, LSTM, Autoencoders, GCN, SVM, and KNN
- Built and validated on a **balanced Kaggle credit card transaction dataset**



##  Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Size: 284,807 transactions
- Balanced for both fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases using PCA anonymization

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

###  1. Stacking Ensemble

Multiple classifiers are trained individually and combined using a meta-classifier to improve predictive performance:
- Base Models: Random Forest, Isolation Forest, LSTM, Autoencoder, SVM, KNN
- Meta-Model: Logistic Regression or another classifier
- Output: Combines base predictions for final fraud classification

###  2. Grid Search Optimization

- All model hyperparameters are tuned using exhaustive **Grid Search**
- Evaluated using metrics like **F1-score**, **ROC-AUC**, and **Precision-Recall**
